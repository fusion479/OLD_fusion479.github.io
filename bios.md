#### Executive Council
##### Saahir
Senior, Co-President

I have always been curious about how machines work, from typewriters to microwaves, and how I can design new machines to solve problems like fossil fuel dependence.  When I entered ninth grade, I knew that I wanted to join robotics to learn about engineering and interact with the STEM community.  Now, as a high school senior, robotics has become an integral part of my life:  robotics has given me the chance to  learn from my school, the FIRST community, and the STEM community overall.  This year, I am excited to take what I have learned and work with my Co-President, Aleksandra, to have a successful and educational season.  It is my role on the team to help plan meetings and events for the team, delegate tasks, and use my experiences as a former Head of Engineering to advise robot development.  Aside from robotics, I enjoy practicing karate, playing flute, and learning Hindi.

##### Aleks
Senior, Co-President

For me, robotics wasn’t love at first sight. Throughout my freshman year I had worked to become more involved in my high school’s theater and music community. I loved (and still love) the feeling of performing  in front of large audiences with a passionate group of people. I didn’t think that involvement in a robotics team could provide me with the same sense of family and fulfillment as delivering a successful play with my fellow performers.  After two years in FTC robotics, I now see that FIRST is so much more than building robots. It is an opportunity to form close bonds with other students, to learn from professionals in various STEM fields, and to inspire others to appreciate the sciences.  As one of 479’s Co-Presidents, my on-team duties include running meetings, overseeing robot code, and helping in robot construction. I am thrilled to be part of a community in which I learn, laugh, and build on a daily basis.

#### Cabinet

##### Michael
Junior, Head of Engineering

This is my second year on 479 Stuy Fusion, and my third year in FTC robotics. In elementary school I was introduced to robotics through Legos and I have been interested in engineering ever since. Although I am a capable programmer, when it comes to robotics I can’t help but gravitate towards engineering - I love being able to build things with my hands and test out new ideas and mechanisms, even if they don’t always work out how I want them to.  Aside from teaching our newbies and building a killer bot, as one of the few members left over from the last generation of 479, I intend to carry on the values that defined my experience on the team: self-discovery, the lightheartedness, and most importantly the sense of family and comradery. Some of my other hobbies include playing the piano and trombone, practicing martial arts, and watching anime.

##### Anthony
Senior, Head of Software

My first experience with robotics was in a 6th grade robotics class. It was the first time I was given the ability to create something of my own. For once, I was in control of what I wanted to make and had the ability to make it. Joining robotics at Stuyvesant allowed me to continue this experience and make new friends in the process. Throughout my last three years on the team, not only have I learned about engineering but also about the community behind STEM and FIRST. As the new Head of Software this year, I want to expand the presence of software engineering on the team.  In addition to robotics, I also like to speed-cube and play basketball.

##### Jon
Senior, Head of Marketing

Hi! I'm 479's Head of Marketing and a senior at Stuyvesant. 
I joined Stuy FTC because I had taken a LEGO robotics class in middle school and wanted to continue learning engineering; in freshman and sophomore year I was heavily involved in our engineering department. Since junior year, I've become dedicated to organizing our team's marketing and outreach projects; I love inspiring others to learn more about robotics and STEM. I also lead our robot's CAD and electronics.
My love for outreach, FIRST and NYC all intersected in May when I founded the NYC FIRST Community Events Planning Committee. As Committee Chairman, I oversee the planning of events complementary to NYC FIRST’s events. 
In my off time, I lead the Stuyvesant Rowing Club & Team as President. I also help build our boats!

##### Matthew
Junior, Director of Operations

My name is Matthew, as you probably already know.  I have been an active member of Stuyvesant FTC Robotics since entering high school (2 years ago).  Over these past years, I have been both interested and involved in software engineering.  However, I have also taken a part in the design and build processes in order to expand my knowledge and skill in a variety of different areas.  The reason I have joined and continue to take part in FTC Robotics is mostly because of my variety of different interests.  Robotics has continued to help me explore the extremely field that is STEM and to pursue potential career paths in the future.  Speaking of the future, I plan to explore more of the marketing and outreach based fields because these allow the team itself to function.  Some of my other interests outside of robotics are a variety of art forms, including dance, visual art, and instrumental music.

##### Shriya
Freshman, Engineering

As a freshman, this is my first year in FTC. However, I have always been interested in robotics, especially the engineering aspect. I have explored these aspects in a STEM Pipeline in Brooklyn Technical High School, as well as other programs related to the EV3 robots. As a part of 479, I would like to further explore my deep interest in engineering and learn techniques and skills from the upperclassmen. I am interested in learning more about different tools and how to use them in different design plans. Although I have done coding, I am more interested in the building aspect. Other than robotics, I am interested in dancing, especially hip-hop, as it is a way to express myself in an energetic way.

##### Lai Wa(Julia) Chu
Junior, Engineering

Hi, my name is Lai Wa. This is my first year on the team. I’m a junior so whenever I tell people that I joined robotics this year they get super surprised because robotics requires a lot of time commitment and junior year is supposed to be the busiest year. But I really just got genuinely interested in robotics last year from taking a comp sci class in school and I’ve always liked building things. Junior year would really be the last year I could join so I did. It’s been a month since I’ve been on the team. The meetings are long and I get really hungry by the end, but when I was working on the robot at the moment, I really couldn’t feel anything else besides to motivation to contribute to the team. I’m really glad that I decided to join robotics after all, and I am excited to learn more about engineering and become more involved in the team.

##### Chris Dou
Freshman, Engineering

Hi, I am currently a freshman at Stuyvesant High School. My first year on FTC team 479 has been a great experience thus far. In middle school, I was involved in robotics pretty often. In 7th grade, we worked with EV3 robots for an hour almost every day. Throughout the year, we coded robots to complete mazes. That got me interested in robots and is one of the main reasons why I am involved in robotics today. School feels like it never ends, but from the end of the 10th period to the end of the meeting, time flies by. Although robotics meetings are long and can go until 9, they are enjoyable and are a great chance to learn about topics that are not taught in school. For example, I can code, build a robot, and learn aspects of marketing and presentation skills. In my spare time, I enjoy practicing martial and rowing and playing basketball and violin. 


##### Eric Lau
Junior, Software Engineering

This is my first year in FTC robotics, and my first year on Stuy 479 Fusion. My first experience with robotics came in 6th grade when I messed around with a LEGO robot. I regained interest last year in sophomore year in Computer Science class when we spent a week near the end of the year programming robots in Python and I thought it was a really fun experience, even though the robots were pretty limited in function. Even though I’ve been a STEM-oriented kind of person for most, if not all of my life, I think I held off on joining robotics because of the time commitment I expected even before joining it. However, after about a month of working with the team during my stressful junior year, I’ve found that the time commitment so far has not been too demanding. The team does a good job of integrating us within their project and making us feel comfortable with everything we need to know. I look forward to being able to write code for one of our robots in the future. 

##### Steven Lei
Freshman, Engineering

I’m a freshman and this is my first year on a robotics team. I’m primarily interested in computers (software/hardware), but sadly my middle school didn’t really have any STEM related extracurriculars besides a small lego robotics class. I heard about Stuyvesant’s various robotics teams, and I decided to join 479 to pursue my interests. I enjoy engineering as I’m working with physical objects that I can apply both math and science to. It reminds me of building legos as a kid but except everything is much more complex and precise. Sometimes working with parts can be frustrating; however it’s a good learning experience as my mentors correct me on the assembly. Time flies during each robotics meeting, and even though I come home late I don’t feel stressed as I enjoyed the time spent. Outside of robotics, I participate in sports like swimming and basketball. Next season, I aim to learn software engineering as well. 

##### Vanessa Lin
Freshman, Engineering

I am a freshman and it’s my first year on any robotics team. My middle school was trash and didn’t have anything so when I came to Stuy’s Open House in October last year and saw the robotics team presenting their robot, I was immediately fascinated. Ever since I was little, I was always interested in building and designing stuff and robotics is the perfect club for that.  I knew that robotics was one of the clubs I was interested in joining. I was also considering joining sports teams but after starting school, I felt that it was too much for me to currently handle. So far, robotics has been very fun. I met a lot of new people and the environment is very friendly. I just didn’t expect how confusing the parts and the uses of them can be. 

##### Steven Wen
Freshman, Marketing

Hi, my name is Steven and I’m part of the FTC 479 team, the future Head of Marketing. I originally wanted to join robotics because it looks cool, building those big and complicated robots always interests me. Engineering and marketing are my main. I always like to build things on my own and the robotics team seems perfect for me. As a freshman and a newbie, I’m completely dedicated to whatever I should learn. To be honest, I didn't know robotics would be this complicated and hard to blend into the environment. I guess time is the key to understand everything. The robotics members are always there to help us and teach us things we still have not yet learned. Right now I got used to the new environment and started to help other people who are in need. Robotics changed me in a positive way. I enjoy being in this robotics team.

##### Alice Zhu
Freshman, Engineering

I am a freshman and this is my first year on FTC 479 team. I am greatly interested in STEM and especially, robotics. Coding, designing, and building robots have always been interesting to me. As a child, I would idealize robots, claiming them as humans with supernatural powers. Now, as a freshman, I strive to sharpen my skills and learn exactly how to build these great structures. I hope to achieve a greater understanding, as well as challenge myself on the FTC 479 team. I really look forward to this upcoming year on the FTC 479 robotics team.
