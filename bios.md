#### Executive Council
##### Saahir
Senior, Co-President

I have always been curious about how machines work, from typewriters to microwaves, and how I can design new machines to solve problems like fossil fuel dependence.  When I entered ninth grade, I knew that I wanted to join robotics to learn about engineering and interact with the STEM community.  Now, as a high school senior, robotics has become an integral part of my life:  robotics has given me the chance to  learn from my school, the FIRST community, and the STEM community overall.  This year, I am excited to take what I have learned and work with my Co-President, Aleksandra, to have a successful and educational season.  It is my role on the team to help plan meetings and events for the team, delegate tasks, and use my experiences as a former Head of Engineering to advise robot development.  Aside from robotics, I enjoy practicing karate, playing flute, and learning Hindi.

##### Aleks
Senior, Co-President

For me, robotics wasn’t love at first sight. Throughout my freshman year I had worked to become more involved in my high school’s theater and music community. I loved (and still love) the feeling of performing  in front of large audiences with a passionate group of people. I didn’t think that involvement in a robotics team could provide me with the same sense of family and fulfillment as delivering a successful play with my fellow performers.  After two years in FTC robotics, I now see that FIRST is so much more than building robots. It is an opportunity to form close bonds with other students, to learn from professionals in various STEM fields, and to inspire others to appreciate the sciences.  As one of 479’s Co-Presidents, my on-team duties include running meetings, overseeing robot code, and helping in robot construction. I am thrilled to be part of a community in which I learn, laugh, and build on a daily basis.

#### Cabinet

##### Michael
Junior, Head of Engineering

This is my second year on 479 Stuy Fusion, and my third year in FTC robotics. In elementary school I was introduced to robotics through Legos and I have been interested in engineering ever since. Although I am a capable programmer, when it comes to robotics I can’t help but gravitate towards engineering - I love being able to build things with my hands and test out new ideas and mechanisms, even if they don’t always work out how I want them to.  Aside from teaching our newbies and building a killer bot, as one of the few members left over from the last generation of 479, I intend to carry on the values that defined my experience on the team: self-discovery, the lightheartedness, and most importantly the sense of family and comradery. Some of my other hobbies include playing the piano and trombone, practicing martial arts, and watching anime.

##### Anthony
Senior, Head of Software

My first experience with robotics was in a 6th grade robotics class. It was the first time I was given the ability to create something of my own. For once, I was in control of what I wanted to make and had the ability to make it. Joining robotics at Stuyvesant allowed me to continue this experience and make new friends in the process. Throughout my last three years on the team, not only have I learned about engineering but also about the community behind STEM and FIRST. As the new Head of Software this year, I want to expand the presence of software engineering on the team.  In addition to robotics, I also like to speed-cube and play basketball.

##### Jon
Senior, Head of Marketing

Hi! I'm 479's Head of Marketing and a senior at Stuyvesant. 
I joined Stuy FTC because I had taken a LEGO robotics class in middle school and wanted to continue learning engineering; in freshman and sophomore year I was heavily involved in our engineering department. Since junior year, I've become dedicated to organizing our team's marketing and outreach projects; I love inspiring others to learn more about robotics and STEM. I also lead our robot's CAD and electronics.
My love for outreach, FIRST and NYC all intersected in May when I founded the NYC FIRST Community Events Planning Committee. As Committee Chairman, I oversee the planning of events complementary to NYC FIRST’s events. 
In my off time, I lead the Stuyvesant Rowing Club & Team as President. I also help build our boats!

##### Matthew
Junior, Director of Operations

My name is Matthew, as you probably already know.  I have been an active member of Stuyvesant FTC Robotics since entering high school (2 years ago).  Over these past years, I have been both interested and involved in software engineering.  However, I have also taken a part in the design and build processes in order to expand my knowledge and skill in a variety of different areas.  The reason I have joined and continue to take part in FTC Robotics is mostly because of my variety of different interests.  Robotics has continued to help me explore the extremely field that is STEM and to pursue potential career paths in the future.  Speaking of the future, I plan to explore more of the marketing and outreach based fields because these allow the team itself to function.  Some of my other interests outside of robotics are a variety of art forms, including dance, visual art, and instrumental music.

##### Sam
Junior, Engineering

This is my second year in FTC robotics, and my first year on Stuy 479 Fusion. I will be working on the construction of our bot. I have always been a very STEM-oriented person, and ever since kindergarten, I have been fascinated by robots. I started out folding my own paper planes, but as I started to grow older, I took an interest in motorized vehicles and machines. It seemed like a sort of next step from manual contraptions. I enjoy being able to apply my skills and interests in a hands-on way. My hobbies include playing chess, swimming, riding my bike, and watching TV.

##### Eric
Junior, Software 

This is my first year in FTC robotics, and my first year on Stuy 479 Fusion. My first experience with robotics came in 6th grade when I messed around with a LEGO robot. I regained interest last year in sophomore year in Computer Science class when we spent a week near the end of the year programming robots in Python and I thought it was a really fun experience, even though the robots were pretty limited in function. Even though I’ve been a STEM-oriented kind of person for most, if not all of my life, I think I held off on joining robotics because of the time commitment I expected even before joining it. However, after about a month of working with the team during my stressful junior year, I’ve found that the time commitment so far has not been too demanding. The team does a good job of integrating us within their project and making us feel comfortable with everything we need to know. I look forward to being able to write code for one of our robots in the future.
