            <small style="line-height:50%;">At every level of competition, whether it be qualifiers, regionals, or championships, I am always asked a daunting question: 
            What does FIRST mean to you? For me, participating in FTC over the last four years has meant opportunity. 
            The competition has given me the opportunity to demonstrate my love for engineering, whether that be through the cardboard prototypes or intricate CAD designs I make. 
            It has given me the opportunity to contribute and communicate with thousands of FIRST students around the world beyond the scope of robotics. 
            Above all, FIRST has given me the opportunity to become a more holistic individual: a community volunteer, a team leader, and a collaborative innovator. 
            As I leave 479, I hope to inspire the next generation to use FTC as a way to expand on their passions and interests.

            <small style="line-height:50%;">Before I participated in FTC, passion and community were words I didn’t really understand. 
            I’ll never forget my first day on my robotics team. 
            At first I watched as teammates worked together to screw in pieces of a mechanism and as the programmer typed away on his laptop 
            while others reset the field for another test drive. 
            Everything and everyone moved with a sense of purpose; the flutter of movement resembled the individual parts of a machine, and like a bearing on a shaft,
             I fit right in.

            <small style="line-height:50%;">I've always been a sort of a computer fanatic growing up, hardware and software are just things I find really cool. 
            After joining 479 as a sophomore, I realized this was just the place to foster the skills I would need going forward while also doing something enjoyable
            with like-minded people. It's worth the time to spend the time working and learning with my teammates through thick and thin. 
            I'm still learning the ropes and getting adjusted to being on the team now that school is in person, but with everyone else's support, I think I'll do just fine. 
            Outside of robotics, my hobbies include playing video games, keeping up with tech, and music.

            <small style="line-height:50%;">Hello! My name is Barnatt Wu. I decided to join team 479 because I like to work on projects with others. 
            After attending an interest meeting, I became captivated with the idea of creating a unique robot while collaborating with others. 
            Since I was a child, I loved to build things with Legos and let my creativity run loose with the limited blocks I owned. 
            Since then, I sought out experiences in  designing and building. 
            Robotics has been a fun, cooperative activity that makes me want to continue working alongside my team in the future.

            <small style="line-height:50%;">From Legos to origami to random dessert recipes I find online, I love to create new things as well as tinker with what's already there.
            I joined Team 479 this school year as a freshman to learn about engineering and electronics while having fun playing with robots. 
            I started out with hardly any relevant experience, but while in robotics, I have been a part of a warm community with people who push each other to learn and achieve more. 
            Outside of school, I like to spend time reading, playing games, and taking walks..

            <small style="line-height:50%;">Hi! I'm Alif Abdullah. I've heard about robotics since I was a freshman, through posters and other classmates, 
            and have decided to join Team 479 in my sophomore year. As the Director of Strategy, I continue to love this club. 
            I'm socially awkward, so initially trying out this new hobby with a bunch of people I don't know seemed like a daunting task. 
            Yet, doing so gave me one of the best activities I've ever been a part of. Being on the robotics team gives me a creative environment to express my ideas,
            surrounded by a team of supporting and smart people. I'm more open and expressive, in a place where I can bring my imagination to reality, 
            and build a robot set to complete any task. Robotics isn't my only hobby. 
            I also enjoy Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, and am an avid fan of all things horror

            <small style="line-height:50%;">I've always been interested in building things. 
            I've always had a fascination for building things and understanding the true nature of how something works. 
            Robotics allows this ambition to foster and allows me to build my understanding of designing and software. 
            I really love this team because everyone is willing to learn and teach. 
            There isn't a single day where I don't have some form of self-realization of something new. 
            Our FTC team isn't just a team for a bot, we're more like a family that looks after each other whenever we need it so the combination makes it best. 
            Besides robotics, I also enjoy playing guitar and coding with friends.

            <small style="line-height:50%;">When robotics started using the same room as Science Olympiad in my sophomore year, I was immediately intrigued. 
            It showed me a whole other side of engineering. I am fascinated at how these complicated parts come together to do something that seems so simple.
            479 also has allowed me to be myself whether it is fooling around or testing random ideas. 
            Outside of school, I like to play basketball, play videogames with friends, and follow tech.

            <small style="line-height:50%;">I have been passionate about engineering for as long as I can remember. I joined 479 this year as a freshman, 
            and I can proudly say that I have no regrets in joining! I love how the general attitude of this team is to first try an idea out before judging it 
            as there is not necessarily such a thing as a "bad idea". The open attitude of the team makes you feel that you are not only working together to build 
            a robot and compete, but to also learn with one another and have fun. Apart from robotics, I like to make music, and mess around with electronics.
