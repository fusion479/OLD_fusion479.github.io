![Notes 9/30/21]()

September 30, 2021 
Today we discussed the splitting of roles for the building and engineering aspect of the bot. We compiled a list of items and resources we had for each objective.
Intake
  - Shafts, Wheels, Chain, Motors, bearings, Belt (UNOWNED)
  - Surgical Tubing, Belt, and Standoffs(owned)
DT
   - Channel (owned)
   - metal odo, belt, sideplates - alum vs Delrin? (UNOWNED)
LIFT
  - Slides, linkage parts (owned)
  - String, Screws, Mountaing(UNOWNED)
Carousel Spin for Duck 
  - Wheel, Motor (Owned)
Capping
  - Servos (Owned)
  - Exact idea not fully planned out. Doesn't make much sense to be part of the same lift, but perhaps another arm/lift on the bot. Could be skipped until other aspects of bot are fully made.

In general we need servo hubs, standoffs, need more organization for items, chain, and Gears, and square beams.

Objective: Get prototypes in the next 2 weekish.
