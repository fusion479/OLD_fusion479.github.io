On September 8, Stuy FTC attended NYC FIRST's FTC Kickoff at NYU Tandon! This year, we did something different; we used Kickoff as an interest meeting for freshmen that were considering joining our teams. We had more than 30 newbies join us for Kickoff, a record level of interest!

For the first half of the day up until Game Reveal, we met up in the morning at NYU Tandon, and attended workshops hosted by NYC FIRST. We were excited to hear that NYC would be using the Super Qualifier system this year! We also hosted a workshop at kickoff - Jon, our Head of Marketing introduced the REV Expansion Hub to a full room of 50+ students and mentors.

After Game Reveal(super exciting!), we walked through the ROVER RUCKUS field and got lunch nearby. We played some icebreaker games before heading back to NYU Tandon's auditorium for a strategy discussion lead by Saahir, our Co-President. We split up into small groups and discussed the best ways to score well in ROVER RUCKUS - many of our newbies enjoyed this. At the end of this, we came up with a priority list of things for scoring this year.
