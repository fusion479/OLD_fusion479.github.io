On September 8, Stuy FTC attended NYC FIRST's FTC Kickoff at NYU Tandon! This year, we did something different; we used Kickoff as an interest meeeting for freshmen that were considering joining our team. We had almost 30 newbies join us for kickoff, a record level of interest in comparison to previous years.
For the first half of the day up until Game Reveal, we met up in the morning at NYU Tandon, and attended workshops hosted ny NYC FIRST. We were excited to hear that NYC would be using the Super Qualifier system this year! We also hosted a workshop - Jon, our Head of Marketing introduced the REV Expansion Hub to a full room of 50+ students and mentors.
