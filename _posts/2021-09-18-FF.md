4/2/20:
Today we talked about some mechanisms. We went over 'rack and pinion' and what a lead screw was. We talked about how it worked and the pros and cons of each, along with the possibility of using them instead of slides and what that would mean. Steven then mentioned how lead screws were used in last year's game, and went over a little bit of recent history about what happened in FTC last year. To wrap things up, we looked at 310's CAD practice folder and were impressed by how far they had gotten, causing some members of the team to be inspired and want to get better at CAD. Finally, we talked a bit about our plans for odometry.
