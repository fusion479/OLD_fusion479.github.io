# January 21, 2021 Meeting Notes

## Outreach
A big part of getting INSPIRE is to have outreach. Due to the regional being in March we are forced to basically do cash in and out meets for outreach.

### short-term Outreach
  1. Making zoom calls  
    - Teaching kids RoadRunner.
    - Teaching kids Engineering (all Steven)
      - CAD Tutorials
      - Aim robotics?!
      - Darts?
  2. Lectures (associated with CS DOJO?)
  3. Going to other middle schools for Outreach

### long-term outreach
  1. Helping elementary schools set up first lego league teams.
    - The judges kept asking specific questions like these, so this is probably going to win us INSPIRE
  2. Have a web of teams that can confidently call us their coaches and become the ring leader of FTC.
  

## Organization
We organized many of the screws we have laying around and the tools in the closet. Everything seems to be back in place after the comp and we are good to go.
We also worked on setting up the tubing (terrain) of the field.

## Future Plans
Due to the fact that only two teams can qualify this year, we are
striving to have a better auton and score or get one of the INSPIRE awards. We're partially banking on the fact that the number one team will get both first place awards because otherwise: we are screwed regardless.
Our next plan is to work on OpenCV and auton. Next week as a team we will tackle this issue and our goal is to have CV and a prototype for auton by the end of next week.
