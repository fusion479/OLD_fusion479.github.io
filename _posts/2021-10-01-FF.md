![Notes 10/1/21]()

Meeting Notes for Friday (10/1/21):
Not many people were able to show up, so Steven, Kellen, and Barnatt helped out by organizing things.
Near the end of the meeting, Eduardo, Zawad, and Ishraq discussed SE Related information, in terms of organization and planning:

Java:
- Zawad and Eduardo are currently taking APCS, but they will prioritizing learning OOP and Java Syntax
- The FTC Library, although simple, is also something they need to familiarize themselves with. This will mainly be done through more in person experimentation

Roadrunner:
- This is also something that requires lab experimentation, once we get around to setting up the field and making a DriveTrain
- They will need to explore the docs and familiarize themselves with tuning process and coding

Timing:
- Newbie ed will suffer a bit, as two people are already in the process of learning. However, it is possible to have them help out during tuning process, and explain bits of code along the way while guiding them if they wish to learn. SE roles are generally more difficult since it requires a level of engineering knowledge in addition to coding skills.
- As SE, we will be going along with the team and writing up code and templates as engineering creates their prototypes and designs for the robot. We will need to help out during prototyping, as SE code can help speed up the prototyping process (as opposed to simply plugging motor into a power source)
