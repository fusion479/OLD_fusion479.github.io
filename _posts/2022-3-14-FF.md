### SE/ROBOT:

Kellen/Victoria/Zawad/Ish : Set up the field. NO EXCUSES! Take a ruler and measure so that each gap between the [barriers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/688234546105286739/952766829380649010/unknown.png) are about 13.75 inches

Kellen/Victoria/Zawad/Ish: Practice Level 3 TELEOP only. Don't do any SE stuff. I need to know exactly what needs to be changed on the deposit. I don't care about shared ATM.
Note any features. Loose screws can be retightened by undoing the belt screw holes.
