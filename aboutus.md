In 2007, we became FTC team 479, and competed in the first FTC competition.  However, in the 2017-18 season, with the Relic Recovery game, our team was fully composed of high school seniors, meaning that there would be no active members for this year's season, 2018-19.  In order to solve this problem, our sister team, team 310, split its members in half: half of the members would remain on 310, and the other half became 479.  All of the veteran members of our team this year were members of 310 last year: our co-presidents; heads of engineering, software, and marketing; and our other members as well. This year we had to create a lot of new team structures that did not exist last year: our social media presence, website, outreach efforts, and even our logo were created this season.
We are a part of the Stuyvesant Robotics, which consists of an FRC team (StuyPulse 694) and two FTC teams (Stuy Fission 310 and Stuy Fusion 479). However, each team has an unique team culture and works independently on its robots. We also each organize and host independent outreach opportunities.


### Our History

In the 2015-16 season, FIRST Res-Q, and the 2016-17 season, Velocity Vortex, our team was able to participate in the New York City Regional Championship at Townsend Harris High School, but in 2017-18, with the Relic Recovery game, we were unable to advance past qualifiers.  We hope that this year, we will be able to apply the lessons we learned from last season as well as from before, to avoid making the same mistakes and hopefully reach farther in the competition that we have ever reached before.
