![Stuy FTC Interest Meeting!](/img/FTC_interest.jpeg)

This year, Stuy FTC held an interest meeting separate from our sister team FRC 694 StuyPulse. 

By branding ourselves as an extracurricular where students can learn, practice and do multiple types of team duties rather than specialize in one, we were able to get 100+ students in attendance. 

Currently, half of them have decided to join Stuy FTC.
